### A Shopping List in Backbone.js

#### About
This is a simple CRUD shopping list written using Backbone.js with an Underscore template.

#### Functionality
* Add an item to the list by hitting enter/return after typing in the input box
* Mark an item as 'bought' by checking its box
* Filter by 'bought' or 'to buy'
* Double-click an item to edit its label
* Click the red 'X' to remove an item
* Items are retained in the browser using localstorage

#### Improvements

##### Testing
Ideally I would develop in a test-driven way using Jasmine.

##### Scope
To improve on this I would add a quantity field and an optional, toogleable, notes textarea to accompany the listed items in case a user would want more detail (for example a specific type of ingredient or favoured brand) hidden from the overview.
